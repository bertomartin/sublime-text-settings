These are my settings for Sublime Text 2.

I made this repo for myself, so I have an easy way to back them up. But if you like 'em, or want to tweak to your liking, cool beans.

On OS X, these files would reside in:

`~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2/Packages/User/`

Note: I am using SublimeLinter, which auto-validates JavaScript files via JSHint (as well as other languages).

So, that's what `jshint_options` pertains to. For more info:
